# Web application

## Front-end

## Back-end

Our backend relies on ASP.NET Core Web API, chosen for its agility and high performance. We've structured it with a three-layer architecture: presentation, business logic, and data access. For database management, we use the Identity Framework, an ORM tool known for simplifying operations and bolstering security. This cohesive blend ensures efficient API development, clear code organization, and robust data handling, laying a solid foundation for our application's performance and scalability.

## Database

We SQL Server for our database. It is a robust, secure, and scalable database management system that provides us with a reliable foundation for our application. It is also compatible with the Identity Framework, which we use for user management, making it a natural choice for our project.

## Authentication

We use auth0 for authentication. Auth0 is a flexible, drop-in solution that handles authentication, authorization, and identity management for us. It provides a secure, reliable, and scalable platform for our application, allowing us to focus on building the best possible experience for our users.
